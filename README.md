# tempreature_converter
This is a simple tempreatuer converter consisting four tempreature units:

1.celsius
2.fahrenheit
3.kelvin
4.rankine

We take input from the users about the units they want to convert and then the result is displayed
That's it
Any idea for improvent will be welcomed
Thank You
